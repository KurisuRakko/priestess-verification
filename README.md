Priestess Verification is a fork of [Cap](https://github.com/tiagozip/cap) by Tiago, licensed under Apache-2.0. Modified by Rakko (KurisuRakko): renamed the user-facing branding.

Priestess Verification is a lightweight, modern open-source CAPTCHA alternative using <a href="https://trycap.dev/guide/effectiveness?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=pow_link" target="_blank">proof-of-work</a> and <a href="https://trycap.dev/guide/instrumentation?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=inst_link" target="_blank">instrumentation challenges</a>. It's fast, private, and extremely simple to integrate.

## Using the widget

The fork distributes the widget through jsDelivr's GitHub channel (there is no npm package):

```html
<!-- pin to a release tag in production, e.g. @v1.0.0 -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KurisuRakko/priestess-verification@main/widget/src/cap.min.js"></script>

<cap-widget data-cap-api-endpoint="https://your-cap-server.example/your-site-key/"></cap-widget>
```

`@main` is cached at jsDelivr's edge for up to 12 hours, so a push to this fork can take that long to reach users. In production, pin the widget to a release tag instead (e.g. `@v1.0.0`, created at release time) or to a commit sha.

Floating mode loads `cap-floating.min.js` from the same directory. The element name, attributes and JavaScript API stay compatible with upstream Cap, so the [upstream documentation](https://trycap.dev) still applies.

Note: `widget/src/cap.compat.min.js` is upstream's legacy compatibility bundle. It still contains the upstream branding and has not been rebuilt.

### Avoiding jsDelivr at runtime

The widget does not bundle everything it needs: at runtime it fetches a PoW wasm module, the optional hashwx wasm module, and (only on browsers without `DecompressionStream`) pako. By default those three URLs point at `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, and the PoW module is prefetched as soon as the widget script loads. The Cloudflare Workers deployment serves all three from the same origin, so set the widget's override variables **before** loading `widget.js`:

```html
<script>
  window.CAP_CUSTOM_WASM_URL = "https://verify.rakko.cn/cap_wasm_bg.wasm";
  window.CAP_CUSTOM_HASHWX_URL = "https://verify.rakko.cn/hashwx.wasm";
  window.CAP_PAKO_URL = "https://verify.rakko.cn/pako_inflate.min.js";
</script>
<script src="https://verify.rakko.cn/widget.js"></script>

<cap-widget data-cap-api-endpoint="https://your-cap-server.example/your-site-key/"></cap-widget>
```

Without those three lines the widget still works, but it makes a cross-origin request to jsDelivr at load time (and falls back to the slower JS solver if that request fails). The demo page at `/` sets all three itself.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

`worker/` is a self-contained Cloudflare Workers deployment of this fork (Durable Objects with the SQLite backend, no KV). It serves the widget and its runtime dependencies (wasm + pako) itself, so the demo page never talks to jsDelivr; embedders get the same guarantee by setting the three `window.CAP_CUSTOM_*` / `window.CAP_PAKO_URL` variables shown above:

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | demo page with a `<cap-widget>` pointed at the same origin |
| `GET /widget.js`, `GET /widget-floating.js` | this repo's `widget/src/cap.min.js` / `cap-floating.min.js`, byte for byte |
| `GET /cap_wasm_bg.wasm`, `GET /hashwx.wasm` | this repo's `wasm/src/browser/*.wasm`, byte for byte |
| `GET /pako_inflate.min.js` | `pako@2.1.0` `dist/pako_inflate.min.js` (sha256 `fa226c8e…f8bb43`, identical to the jsDelivr copy) |
| `POST /challenge`, `POST /redeem` | challenge generation / redemption via `core/` (scope `site`) |
| `POST /siteverify` | server-to-server validation for your backend |
| `POST /demo/challenge`, `POST /demo/redeem`, `POST /demo/siteverify` | the demo page's own endpoints (scope `demo`); `/demo/siteverify` needs no secret and only accepts demo-scoped tokens |

Every route whose response headers depend on `Origin` — the widget assets, the wasm/pako files, `/challenge` and `/redeem` — sends `Vary: Origin` unconditionally, including for requests without an `Origin` header, so a cached no-`Origin` variant can never be replayed to a CORS caller.


### Local development

```sh
cd worker
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # then replace both secrets
npm run dev                      # http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

`wrangler.jsonc` pins a single `compatibility_date` (`2026-09-25`) that `wrangler dev`, the vitest pool and `wrangler deploy` all use, so local, CI and production run the same runtime semantics.

Automated checks:

```sh
npm test                                             # vitest + @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers
node scripts/acceptance.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8787    # curl-style end-to-end checks
node scripts/browser-e2e.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8787  # real browser; fails if anything hits cdn.jsdelivr.net
node scripts/cpu-bench.mjs                           # CPU cost of /challenge, /redeem, /siteverify
```

### Deploy

The custom domain is attached by the deploy itself, so the account needs the zone first:

- the `rakko.cn` zone must be in the same Cloudflare account, active, and the account needs Workers + Durable Objects access;
- `verify.rakko.cn` must not already exist as a conflicting DNS record (`custom_domain: true` makes wrangler create the proxied record; an existing A/AAAA/CNAME with the same name fails the deploy);
- `workers_dev` is `false`, so the only address is the custom domain — if the route fails to attach, the deploy fails rather than silently going live on `*.workers.dev`. For a first deploy on a fresh account, temporarily set `"workers_dev": true` to get a fallback URL.

```sh
cd worker
npm install                                  # required: wrangler.jsonc points its $schema at node_modules
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler secret put CAP_SECRET           # e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
npx wrangler secret put SITEVERIFY_SECRET    # e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
npx wrangler deploy
```

`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is a comma separated list of extra browser origins allowed to call `/challenge`, `/redeem` and the widget assets; the worker's own origin is always allowed, and `/siteverify` never sends CORS headers.

### Calling `/siteverify` from your backend

Use the same shape as the standalone server, so the dashboard snippet keeps working:

```js
const res = await fetch("https://verify.rakko.cn/siteverify", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ secret: process.env.SITEVERIFY_SECRET, response: token }),
});
const { success } = await res.json();
```

`token` is what the widget hands your page (`event.detail.token` on the `solve` event, or the hidden `cap-token` input). Tokens are single use: verifying the same token twice returns `{ success: false }`. Never call `/siteverify` from the browser — it needs the secret; the demo page uses the same-origin-only `/demo/siteverify` instead, which takes no secret and only accepts tokens minted by `/demo/challenge` + `/demo/redeem` (production tokens are rejected there, and demo tokens are rejected by `/siteverify`).

### Configuration

All optional tuning lives in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars` (defaults shown): `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (`https://verify.rakko.cn`), `CHALLENGE_COUNT` (50), `CHALLENGE_SIZE` (32), `CHALLENGE_DIFFICULTY` (4), `INSTRUMENTATION_LEVEL` (3), `BLOCK_AUTOMATED_BROWSERS` (false), `TOKEN_TTL_MS` (20 min), `CHALLENGE_PROTOCOLS` (empty = format 1), `HASHWX_DIFFICULTY` (1000000), `HASHWX_CHALLENGE_COUNT` (4).

Instrumentation obfuscation levels 4-10 fall back to a weaker script inside Workers, because `esbuild` (native binary) and `javascript-obfuscator` cannot run in workerd. Keep `INSTRUMENTATION_LEVEL` at 3 (the default) unless you have measured the trade-off yourself.

### Free plan capacity

Cloudflare's free-tier limits ([Durable Objects pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/), last updated Aug 25, 2026): **100,000 requests/day** (the page states requests "Includes HTTP requests, RPC sessions, WebSocket messages, and alarm invocations") and **100,000 rows written/day**, with the footnotes "Each `setAlarm()` is billed as a single row written" and "Deletes are counted as rows written".

One full verification (`/challenge` → `/redeem` → `/siteverify`) costs:

| Metered dimension | Cost per verification | Free limit ÷ cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable Object rows written | **3** — the redeem INSERT (claim + token row), the siteverify UPDATE that consumes it, and the sweep DELETE | **33,333 / day** |
| Durable Object requests | **2** — one to redeem, one to verify (plus the alarms, below) | ~50,000 / day |
| Worker requests | **3** — challenge, redeem, siteverify (the widget/page itself is cached) | ~33,000 / day |

So the free plan supports **~33,000 verifications/day**, and **rows written is the binding limit**. That is why the store keeps one row per redeem — the challenge claim and the token are the same row — has **no secondary indexes** (every index entry is billed as an extra row written on insert and delete), keeps the alarm cadence at 5 minutes and only calls `setAlarm()` when none is pending (4 shards × 288 alarms/day ≈ 1,150 alarms and ≈ 1,150 extra row writes per day, i.e. ~1% of the budget).

Expired rows are still cleaned up: deletes happen opportunistically on write (at most once per 5 minutes per shard) and from the alarm while rows remain; a row that outlives its `expires` is rejected by `/siteverify` with `Token expired` because the expiry is checked on read, so the sweep is about storage hygiene, not correctness. The atomicity and single-use guarantees are unchanged: the redeem INSERT is "insert if absent" (a replayed challenge gets `already_redeemed`), and verification is a single conditional `UPDATE … RETURNING` that can only succeed once.

## Documentation

**[Read the docs](https://trycap.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=read_docs)**, try the [demo](https://trycap.dev/guide/demo.html?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=demo_link)

The documentation site belongs to the upstream project and has not been migrated to this fork: its examples still load the widget from the npm package `@cap.js/widget`. In this fork, load the widget from jsDelivr as shown in [Using the widget](#using-the-widget), and set `WIDGET_VERSION` to a git tag or commit of this fork.
